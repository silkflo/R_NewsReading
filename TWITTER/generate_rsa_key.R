# Generate your private key and write it to the folder,
# we assume you will save it to the folder C:/Users/UserName/.ssh/ mac users can adapt the path...

# if necessary install package
# install.packages("openssl"); install.packages("tidyverse")
# loads library open ssl and tidyverse
library(openssl)
library(tidyverse)

# private and public key path (adapt path for your computer)
path_private_key <- file.path("C:/Users/Flori/.ssh", "id_api")
path_public_key <- file.path("C:/Users/Flori/.ssh", "id_api.pub")
